// about the shape of the tree they share. This module is pure: no main, no
// writes, Node core only, so the bundler can import it without running a tool.
//
// It is listed in BUILD_IDENTITY_FILES (tools/buildversion.mjs): a change here
// changes what the mobile bundle carries, so it moves build identity.
